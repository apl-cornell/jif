#   This is optional if the Polyglot JARs are in the lib directory.
#   Must be an absolute path.

jdk.home=${java.home}
# The following may work better if you have the JAVA_HOME environment variable
# defined:
# jdk.home=${env.JAVA_HOME}

# You may need something like the following on Mac OS
# jif-runtime-native.java-include-dir=${jdk.home}/include
