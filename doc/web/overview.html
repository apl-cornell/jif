<p>
Jif is an extension to the Java programming language that adds
static analysis of information flow for improved security
assurance.  The primary goal is to prevent confidential information
from being used improperly; in some versions of Jif, the goal is
also to protect the integrity of trusted information.
</p>

<p>
The largest difference between Jif and Java is the addition of
<em>labels</em> that express security policies as
restrictions on how information may be used.
These labels facilitate
statically tracking information flow. The
analysis of information flow is performed mostly statically, at
compile time. However, Jif does also support some forms of
run-time security enforcement.
</p>

<p>
Static checking of information flow
in Jif programs is performed as part of type checking. If a Jif program
type-checks, the compiler translates it into Java code that can be
compiled with a standard Java compiler. The Jif compiler and run-time
system are available from the
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif">Jif web site</a>.
</p>

<p>
Jif is based on the JFlow language described in the <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/popl99/myers-popl99.ps.gz">Practical
Mostly-Static Information Flow Control</a>, published in the <i>Proceedings of the
26th ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages</i> (POPL),
pp. 228-241, January 1999, by Andrew C. Myers.
</p>

<p>
Another source of documentation for Jif can be found in Andrew Myers'
thesis, linked to from the <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif/">Jif web site</a>. However, the
language has developed since that time, and some features in this
version of Jif are not documented in the thesis.
