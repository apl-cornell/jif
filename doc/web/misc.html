<h1><a name="java">Interacting with Java</a></h1>

<h2><a name="main"></a>The <code>main</code> method</h2>

<p>Jif provides two possible signatures for the main method of a
class. The first is compatible with the signature for Java main
methods, and accepts a single argument of an array of <code>String</code>, that is,
<div class="code"><pre>
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
</pre></div>


<p>The second signature takes two arguments, the first a principal, and
the second an array of <code>String</code>:

<div class="code"><pre>
public static void main(principal p, String[] args) { ... }
</pre></div>


<p>The principal <code>p</code> is the principal representing the current user that invoked the <code>main</code>. The signature
may optionally have the authority of the current user:

<div class="code"><pre>
public static void main(principal p, String[] args) where caller(p)
{
    ...
}
</pre></div>

<p>A class may have at most one static method named
<code>main</code>. Classes with label or principal parameters cannot
have a <code>main</code> method, as there is no way to specify
appropriate instantiations for the parameters when invoking the
<code>main</code> method.</p>

<h2><a name="java-classes"></a>Interacting with Java classes</h2>

<p>The Jif compiler provides a mechanism to allow Jif code to be compiled
against and linked to existing Java classes. However, appropriate Jif
signatures must be supplied for the Java classes. <b>NOTE: the Jif compiler
does not verify that the Java code conforms to these provided
signatures.</b>

<p>
Suppose that you have an existing Java class, called <code>Foo</code>,
i.e. you have a file <code>Foo.java</code>, and a file
<code>Foo.class</code> that was produced by compiling
<code>Foo.java</code>. Furthermore, suppose you want to use the class
<code>Foo</code> in some Jif code you are writing. You can do this by supplying a
Jif signature for the class <code>Foo</code>; at compile time, your Jif code will
be compiled against the signature you provide, but at runtime the
original <code>Foo.class</code> will be loaded. The steps for doing this are as
follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> In a file <code>Foo.jif</code> write an appropriate Jif signature for the
   methods and fields in the class <code>Foo</code>.  Take a look at
   $JIF/sig-src/java/lang/*.jif for some examples of this.

   <p>Note the use of the <code>native</code> flag to avoid the need to provide a
   body for the methods. Note also that there is a <code>private static int</code>
   field named <code>__JIF_SIG_OF_JAVA_CLASS$20030619</code>; this is a hack to
   let the Jif compiler to know that the class provides a Jif
   signature for an existing Java class.
</li>

<li> Compile <code>Foo.jif</code> to produce the file <code>Foo.class</code>
</li>

<li> Make sure that the <code>Foo.class</code> you created in step 2 is on the
   signature classpath. Do this either by dropping the class file into
   the $JIF/sig-classes directory, or by specifying the directory with
   the <code>-addsigcp</code> flag to the Jif compiler. 
</li>

<li> Compile your Jif code that uses the class <code>Foo</code>. The Jif compiler
   will use the signature you created in step 1 when compiling your Jif code.
</li>

<li> To run your Jif compiled code, make sure that the original
   <code>Foo.class</code> is on the classpath, but that the
   <code>Foo.class</code> you created in step 2 is not. Thus, when
   running your Jif compiled code, the original <code>Foo.class</code>
   will be loaded by the classloader.
</li>
</ol>

<p>More explicitly, here is a suggested directory structure.</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
jif-src/
   Bar.jif <span class="comment">// Jif code that uses the Java class Foo</span>

java-src/
   Foo.java <span class="comment">// Java source code</span>
   Quux.java <span class="comment">// More Java source code, not used by any Jif code</span>

sig-src/
   Foo.jif <span class="comment">// Jif signature for the Java source code</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Now compile the Java code. (You'll need to create the directory <code>java-classes</code> first.)
<div class="code"><pre>
$ javac -d java-classes -sourcepath java-src java-src/*.java
</pre></div>

<p class="cont">
Now compile the Jif signatures of the Java code. (Create the directory <code>sig-classes</code> first.)
<div class="code"><pre>
$ $JIF/bin/jifc -d sig-classes -sourcepath sig-src \
      sig-src/Foo.jif
</pre></div>


<p class="cont">
Now compile the Jif code. (Create the directory <code>jif-classes</code> first.)
<div class="code"><pre>
$ $JIF/bin/jifc -d jif-classes -sourcepath jif-src \ 
      -addsigcp sig-classes \ 
      -classpath &quot;java-classes:$CLASSPATH&quot; jif-src/Bar.jif
</pre></div>

<p class="cont">
Note that the signature class is added to the signature classpath
using <code>-addsigcp sig-classes</code>, and the Java classes are put
on the classpath using <code>-classpath
&quot;java-classes:$CLASSPATH&quot;</code>.

<p>
To run code, make sure that the classpath contains both
<code>java-classes</code> and <code>jif-classes</code>, but that it
<b>does not</b> contain <code>sig-classes</code>: 

<div class="code"><pre>
$ $JIF/bin/jif -classpath &quot;java-classes:jif-classes:$CLASSPATH&quot; Bar
</pre></div>


<p>Two other indicator fields can also be used in the Jif signature file of a 
Java class:
<ul>
<li> <code>__JIF_SAFE_CONSTRUCTORS$20050907</code>
<p>Adding a <code>private static int</code> field named
<code>__JIF_SAFE_CONSTRUCTORS$20050907</code> to a Jif signature file is an
assertion that during the execution of the constructors of the Java class there
is no possible way to access a final field of a subclass of the class 
(for example, by invoking an overridden method that accesses final fields,
or by leaking a reference to the object being created to some class that
may attempt to access a final field of the class). Accessing final fields before
they are initialized may be leveraged to leak information; the Jif typing rules
prevent any access to final fields before they are accessed.</p>

<p>The assertion that the Java constructors are &quot;safe&quot; means the Jif
compiler can impose fewer restrictions in the constructor bodies of Jif 
subclasses of the Java class.
</li>

<li> <code>__JIF_PARAMS_RUNTIME_REPRESENTED$20051007</code>
<p>Adding a <code>private static int</code> field named
<code>___JIF_PARAMS_RUNTIME_REPRESENTED$20051007</code> to a Jif signature file 
is an assertion that the Java class conforms to the Jif conventions for
runtime representation of label and principal parameters. 

Suppose that we have some Java class <code>C</code> and the Jif signature for 
the class states that the class has <i class="math">n</i> parameters:
<code>class C[<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> <i class="math">q</i><sub>1</sub>,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> <i class="math">q</i><sub>n</sub>]
    </code>,
 where each <i class="math">Q<sub>i</sub></i> is either <code>label</code>
 or <code>principal</code>, and <i class="math">q<sub>i</sub></i> is the name
 of the <i class="math">i</i>th parameter.
 
<p>Then the Java class <code>C</code> must conform to the following conventions:
<ol>
<li> <p>If <code>C</code> is not an interface, then a method 
    <code>public static boolean 
    jif$Instanceof(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an, Object o)</code> must be present 
    in the class, where each <i class="math">Q<sub>i</sub></i> is either
    <code>jif.lang.Label</code> or <code>jif.lang.Principal</code> as 
    appropriate.
    
    <p>The method must return <code>true</code> if and only if the 
    object <code>o</code>
    is an instance of <code>C[a1, ..., an]</code>, that is, the class 
    <code>C</code> instantiated with the parameters <code>a1, ..., an</code>.
    
    <p>The method may not throw any exceptions.
    
<li>  <p>If <code>C</code> is not an interface, then a  method 
    <code>public static C
    jif$cast$<i>classname</i>(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an, Object o)</code> must be present 
    in the class, where each <i class="math">Q<sub>i</sub></i> is either
    <code>jif.lang.Label</code> or <code>jif.lang.Principal</code> as 
    appropriate, and <i>classname</i> is the full classname of the 
    Java class <code>C</code>, with periods (&quot;<code>.</code>&quot;) 
    replaced by underscores (&quot;<code>_</code>&quot;) (e.g., for the 
    class <code>C</code> in the package <code>foo.bar</code>, 
    <i>classname</i> would be <code>foo_bar_C</code>). 
    
    
    <p>The method must return <code>o</code> if and only if the 
    object <code>o</code>
    is an instance of <code>C[a1, ..., an]</code>, that is, the class 
    <code>C</code> instantiated with the parameters <code>a1, ..., an</code>.
    
    <p>Otherwise, the method must throw a <code>ClassCastException</code>.
    
<li> <p>For each static method <code>m(...)</code> declared in the Jif 
    signature, the Java class must provide a static method
    <code>m(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an, ...)</code>.
    
    <p>Jif code that calls the static method <code>m</code> on 
    class <code>C[a1, ..., an]</code> will be translated into the Java
    method call <code>C.m(a1, ..., an, ...)</code>.

<li> <p>For each constructor <code>C(...)</code> declared in the Jif 
    signature, the Java class must provide a constructor
    <code>C(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an, ...)</code>.
    
    <p>Jif code that constructs new <code>C</code> objects via a 
    <code>new</code> expression
    (<code>new C[a1, ..., an](...)</code> will be translated into the Java
    code <code>new C(a1, ..., an, ...)</code>.

    <p>Note that if Jif classes are able to subclass the class 
    <code>C</code>, then the Jif typing rules require that the Jif signature for 
    <code>C</code> includes a default constructor (that is, a constructor
    with no arguments), and thus the Java code for the class <code>C</code> must
    provide a constructor 
    <code>C(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an)</code>

<li> <p>If <code>C</code> is an interface, then a class named 
<code>C_JIF_IMPL</code> in the same package, with the same visibility
must be provided. This class must contain two static methods: <code>public static boolean 
    jif$Instanceof(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an, Object o)</code> and
    <code>public static C
    jif$cast$<i>classname</i>(<i class="math">Q</i><sub>1</sub> a1,
    ..., <i class="math">Q</i><sub>n</sub> an, Object o)</code>. These two
    methods provide
    implementations for <code>instanceof</code> tests and class casts, as
    described above in items 1 and 2.
    
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="debugging"></a>Debugging Jif programs</h1> 

<p>Tracking down and correcting compilation errors in Jif code can be
difficult. While there is not as yet a debugger specifically for the
Jif language, the Jif compiler has a number of reporting options that
will result in additional information being displayed.


<h2><a name="explain"></a>Constraint explanations</h2>

<p>The <code>-explain</code> or <code>-e</code> flag of the Jif compiler can be used to view
more information about failed label checking. For example, consider
the program, in which there is a potential implicit information flow
from the high security argument <code>h</code>, whose label is the dynamic label
<code>lbl</code>, to the low security local variable <code>l</code>:

<div class="code"><pre>
class Implicit {
    void m(boolean{*lbl} h, label{} lbl) {
        if (lbl <= new label {Alice:}) {
            boolean{} l = false;
            if (h) {
                l = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre></div>

Trying to compile this program produces the following output:

<div class="code"><pre>
$ $JIF/bin/jifc Implicit.jif
Implicit.jif:6: Label of right hand side not less restrictive than the label
    for local variable l
                l = true;
                ^

1 error.
</pre></div>

<p>More information can be gleaned by using the <code>-explain</code> flag:

<div class="code"><pre>
$ $JIF/bin/jifc Implicit.jif -explain
Implicit.jif:6: Unsatisfiable constraint:    
     rhs.nv &lt;= label of var l    
        {h; caller_pc; lbl} &lt;= {caller_pc; _: _; _!: _}    
     in environment    
     [{this} &lt;= {caller_pc}, {*lbl} &lt;= {Alice: }]    
        
     Label Descriptions    
     ------------------    
     - rhs.nv = label of successful evaluation of right hand of assignment    
     - rhs.nv = {h; caller_pc; lbl}    
     - label of var l = {caller_pc; _: _; _!: _}    
     - h = polymorphic label of formal argument h of method m (bounded above
    by {*lbl})    
     - caller_pc = The pc at the call site of this method (bounded above by
    {*: })    
     - lbl = polymorphic label of formal argument lbl of method m (bounded
    above by {})    
     - this = label of the special variable "this"    
     - *lbl = dynamic label represented by the final access path lbl    
        
     More information is revealed by the successful evaluation of the right
    hand side of the assignment than is allowed to flow to the local variable
    l.
                l = true;
                ^

1 error.
</pre></div>

<p>The more detailed error message first shows what the symbolic
unsatisfiable constraint is (<code>rhs.nv <= label of var l</code>),
and then shows the same constraints with the actual labels substituted
for the symbols (<code>{h; caller_pc; lbl} <= {caller_pc; _: _; _!:
_}</code>). The label environment in which the constraint must be
satisfied is also shown. Here, the environment indicates that the
value held in the label variable <code>lbl</code> is bounded above by
the label <code>{Alice:}</code>, and that the label of the receiver
object (<code>{this}</code>) is bounded above by the label
<code>{caller_pc}</code>. Brief descriptions of the labels that appear
in the unsatisfiable constraint are also shown. Here, we see that
<code>rhs.nv</code> represents the label of the information that may
be acquired by knowing the <em>v</em>alue of the successful
(<em>n</em>ormal) evaluation of the <em>r</em>ight <em>h</em>and
<em>s</em>ide of the assignment; for this assignment, that label is
<code>{h; caller_pc; lbl}</code>, where <code>{h}</code> and
<code>{lbl}</code> are the labels of the formal arguments
<code>h</code> and <code>lbl</code>, and <code>{caller_pc}</code>
represents the <u>pc</u> of the call site, which is bounded above the
method's begin-label, which in this case is the most restrictive
label, <code>{*: }</code>.</p>


<h2><a name="report"></a>Detailed reporting</h2>

<p>Sometimes the additional information provided by the <code>-explain</code> option
is not sufficient to determine why a Jif program fails to
compile. There are two additional useful ways to gain more information
about the label checking process: reporting the topics <code>debug</code> and
<code>solver</code>.

Specifying the command line option <code>-report debug=</code><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a
non-negative integer, will display more information about labels. The
higher the value for <i>n</i>, the more information is displayed. For
example:
<div class="code"><pre>
$ $JIF/bin/jifc Implicit.jif -report debug=1 -explain
Implicit.jif:6: Unsatisfiable constraint:    
     rhs.nv &lt;= label of var l    
        {&lt;arg h {&lt;dynamic lbl&gt;}&gt;; &lt;arg caller_pc {*: ; _!: _}&gt;; &lt;arg lbl {_: _;
    _!: _}&gt;} &lt;= {&lt;arg caller_pc {*: ; _!: _}&gt;; _: _; _!: _}    
     in environment    
     [{&lt;this (of Implicit)&gt;} &lt;= {&lt;arg caller_pc {*: ; _!: _}&gt;}, {&lt;dynamic
    lbl&gt;} &lt;= {&lt;pr-external Alice&gt;: ; _!: _}]    
        
     Label Descriptions    
     ------------------    
     - rhs.nv = label of successful evaluation of right hand of assignment    
     - rhs.nv = {&lt;arg h {&lt;dynamic lbl&gt;}&gt;; &lt;arg caller_pc {*: ; _!: _}&gt;; &lt;arg
    lbl {_: _; _!: _}&gt;}    
     - label of var l = {&lt;arg caller_pc {*: ; _!: _}&gt;; _: _; _!: _}    
     - &lt;arg h {&lt;dynamic lbl&gt;}&gt; = polymorphic label of formal argument h of
    method m (bounded above by {&lt;dynamic lbl&gt;})    
     - &lt;arg caller_pc {*: ; _!: _}&gt; = The pc at the call site of this method
    (bounded above by {*: ; _!: _})    
     - &lt;arg lbl {_: _; _!: _}&gt; = polymorphic label of formal argument lbl of
    method m (bounded above by {_: _; _!: _})    
     - &lt;this (of Implicit)&gt; = label of the special variable &quot;this&quot;    
     - &lt;dynamic lbl&gt; = dynamic label represented by the final access path lbl    
        
     More information is revealed by the successful evaluation of the right
    hand side of the assignment than is allowed to flow to the local variable
    l.
                l = true;
                ^

1 error.
</pre></div>


<p>In the environment, we see that the label of the actual argument
for <code>h</code> is displayed as <code>&lt;arg h {&lt;dynamic
lbl&gt;}&gt;</code>. That is, we see that the label is the argument
label for the argument <code>h</code>, and that this arg-label is
bounded above by the label <code>&lt;dynamic lbl&gt;</code>, that is by the dynamic label 
<code>lbl</code>.</p>

<p>The arg-label for <code>h</code> would normally be displayed simply
as <code>h</code>, and the dynamic label <code>lbl</code> would normal
be displayed as <code>*lbl</code>. But with the <code>debug</code>
topic reporting at level 1, we see more detail about the labels, which
can be helpful to determine what reasoning the compiler is
performing. Setting the report level higher reveals even more
information.</p>

<p>Thus, reporting the debug topic provides more information about
the labels and their meaning, but a less readable display.</p>


<p>Specifying the command line option <code>-report solver=</code><i>n</i>, for a
nonnegative <i>n</i>, will display more information about the constraint
solver, which attempts to solve the system of constraints generated by
label checking. The higher the value for <i>n</i>, the more information is
displayed.</p>

<p>When the constraint solver is unable to solve a system of constraints,
it attempts to find the most appropriate constraint to &quot;blame&quot;: this
is the constraint that is displayed in the error message. However,
sometimes this constraint is not the real culprit, and one or more
other constraints are really preventing successful
compilation. Enabling reporting for the solver allows the user to
determine which constraint(s) are problematic, when the error message
does not appear to be helpful.</p>

<h1><a name="runtime-interface">Jif runtime interface</a></h1>


<p>To interact with the external environment, Jif provides a runtime
interface to allow Jif code to read and write files, and access stdin,
stdout and stderr, and also to obtain a principal representing the current user. The runtime interface is <code>jif.runtime.Runtime</code>.
</p>

<p>Although
the runtime code is itself is written in Java (see $JIF/rt-src/jif/runtime/Runtime.java), a Jif signature is
provided to allow calls to this interface can be checked
statically (see $JIF/sig-src/jif/runtime/Runtime.jif).
