Changes in Jif
==============

1. JifOptions - constructSignatureClasspath, constructJifClasspath, constructOutputClassExtClasspath and
                constructPostCompilerClasspath have been deleted. All of theses classpaths are now 
                handled by jif's instance of file manager (ExtFileManager).
