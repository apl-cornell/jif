<p>This package contains the Jif compiler and the Polyglot extensible Java
compiler toolkit.</p>
<p><b>Jif</b> is a security-typed programming language that extends Java with
support for static information flow control. It is being developed by the
research group of <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru">Prof. Andrew Myers</a>
at <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>. Jif is written
in Java and is built on top of the <b>Polyglot</b> extensible Java compiler
toolkit.</p>
<p><font size="3">The current version of Jif is available from <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif</a></font></p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installing Jif</h2>
<p>Suppose you have already downloaded and unpacked the Jif Distribution. Your installation directory contains the following
sub-directories:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>src</b>: the complete source code of the Jif compiler</li>
<li> <b>lib</b>: the Jif runtime libary files, the Polyglot library files and the Java
    Cup library</li>
    <li> <b>doc</b>: the documentations</li>
    <li> <b>demo</b>: Jif sample programs</li>
    <li> <b>images</b>: logos</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
To install Jif, we require the following:
<ul>
<li> JDK 1.2 must be installed and in your path.  This includes
the binaries:
<b>java</b>,
<b>javac</b>,
<b>javah</b>,
<b>jar</b>,
<b>javadoc</b>, and
<b>rmic</b>
and the libraries <b>tools.jar</b> and <b>rt.jar</b>.
</li>

<li> On Windows, you will need the Cygwin environment.  Invoke
<code>bash</code> and ensure your path is set up properly as above.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Installing the Jif compiler</h3>
Follow these steps to install the Jif compiler:
<ol>
  <li>Change directory to the top level directory of your unpacked
  Jif distribution, <b>jif</b>.</li>
  <li>Run &quot;<code>sh ./configure</code>&quot;.</li>
    Two new sub-directories will be created: <b>bin</b> and <b>users</b>. The
    <b>bin</b> directory contains scripts for running the Jif compiler. The <b>users</b>
    directory contains the <b>jif.principal</b> package, in which you can find
    the classes representing the principals on your local machines and some
    sample principals like Alice and Bob. See <a href="doc/jif_programming.html#principal">Create
    Principals</a> for more information.
  <li>Update the <b>PATH</b> environment variable to include the <b>jif/bin</b>
    directory. Or copy the files in the bin directory to a directory appearing
    in your <b>PATH</b> environment variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can test your Jif compiler installation. Go to the <b>demo</b> directory and run:</p>
    <p>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jifc Hello.jif</code><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jif Hello</code>
    </p>
    <p>If you see <code>&quot;Hello, the world!&quot;</code> printed on the screen, you have
successfully installed Polyglot. Otherwise, make sure that you have followed every<br>
instruction. If you still cannot run the Hello demo, please contact the authors.</p>
<p>To rebuild the Jif compiler, go to the <b>src</b> directory, run:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>make</code></p>
<p>The output directory for class files is <b>src/classes</b>. (On the Windows
system, you will need a Microsoft C++ compiler to rebuild Jif.)</p>
