- To Solve dynreclTest7 we need to add a case for RifJoinConfPolicy_c in method policyToJava,
in class PairLabelToJavaExpr_c. Do we need to add more for the runtime representation of rifspecs? 
- To solve dynreclTest8, we know that the "new label" syntax takes as an argument a label (not a dynamic_label).
We need to create a new node for f(label). Then we need to add one more case at "extend primary" rule for
NEW:n LABEL f(label).
- Solve dynreclTest4.
- The last case of label_flexible at the parser is wrong, because it considers only the first case of dynamic_label.
- See if solver can deduce true facts about automata (i.e L1>f(L2) => g(L1)>g(f(L2)) )
- Enable f(rifspec) to be the proper automaton.
- How is f1(f2(f3(L))) resolved?
- Dynamic labels: give rifspec as an input, or assign a rifspec in a variable.
- allPossibleActions contains all the actions that appear in the program.
 Somehow this list should be initialized when the whole program is parsed. (it is currently default)
- Printing
- Integrity
- Examples (paper review / battleship)
