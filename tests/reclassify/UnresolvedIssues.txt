- More tests on dynamic labels (programs should be compiled and executed)
- Dynamic labels: give rifspec as an input, or assign a rifspec in a variable.
- allPossibleActions contains all the actions that appear in the program.
 Somehow this list should be initialized when the whole program is parsed. (it is currently default)

- Conservatism of type-checking: LabelEnv_c at leq(ConfPolicy,ConfPolicy,SearchState) at 2nd case (and at ReaderPolicy.java at relabelsTo). 
If I need to check p1<=p1' join L join p2', what happens if the environment knows p1<=p1' join L join p2', or
p1<= L join p (p=p1' join p2'), or p1<=L?

- write a report with all changes i have introduced + comments in the code
- write down the experience/problems/techniques you met/used during developing calendar.
Not many people have developed these programs, and so your epxerience may help others.

- rif_join_list seems that is not used in jif.ppg.
