- Does rif[L1;..] work?
- See if solver can deduce true facts about automata (i.e L1>f(L2) => g(L1)>g(f(L2)) )
- Dynamic labels: give rifspec as an input, or assign a rifspec in a variable.
- allPossibleActions contains all the actions that appear in the program.
 Somehow this list should be initialized when the whole program is parsed. (it is currently default)
- Printing
- Integrity
- Examples (paper review / battleship)
- Conservatism of type-checking: LabelEnv_c at leq(ConfPolicy,ConfPolicy,SearchState) at 2nd case (and at ReaderPolicy.java at relabelsTo). 
If I need to check p1<=p1' join L join p2', what happens if the environment knows p1<=p1' join L join p2', or
p1<= L join p (p=p1' join p2'), or p1<=L?
