BattleShip
----------

BattleShip is a simple game between two players. Each player has a
secret board that contains a number of ships. Players take turns to
ask if a coordinate on the opponent's board is contains a ship. The
object is to locate all of the opponent's ships first.

This simple game has interesting security properties. Each player has
secret information: the location of ships on the board. Some of this
secret information must be declassified when the opponent asks if a
ship is occupying a given co-ordinate.

The BattleShip game is implemented in the classes BattleShip, Player,
Board, Ship and Coordinate. The class Main provides code for
instantiating the game for the principals Alice and Bob.


To compile and run the BattleShip example:

1. Ensure that the principals Alice and Bob are present.

   The code for the principals is in the $JIF/tests directory. To
   compile the code for the principals, perform the following
   commands.
        $ cd $JIF/tests
        $ javac -d . -classpath $JIF/rt-classes jif/principal/Alice.java jif/principal/Bob.java

2. Ensure that the Jif compiler is working.
  
   See $JIF/doc for information on compiling the Jif compiler.

3. Compile the BattleShip classes

        $ cd $JIF/examples/battleship
        $ $JIF/bin/jifc -classpath $JIF/tests *.jif

   The $JIF/tests directory must be included on the classpath so the
   Jif compiler can locate the principals Alice and Bob.

4. Execute the BattleShip example

        $ cd $JIF/examples/battleship
        $ $JIF/bin/jif -classpath "$JIF/tests:." Main
   
   The output should resemble the following.

	Playing battleships, with each player having 10 covered coordinates
	  Initializing.... Done.
	  Playing rounds...
		Alice: (0, 0)?  N   Bob: (0, 0)?  N   Score: 0 vs. 0
		Alice: (1, 0)?  N   Bob: (1, 0)?  N   Score: 0 vs. 0
		Alice: (0, 1)?  N   Bob: (0, 1)?  N   Score: 0 vs. 0
		Alice: (0, 2)?  N   Bob: (0, 2)?  N   Score: 0 vs. 0
		Alice: (1, 1)?  Y   Bob: (1, 1)?  Y   Score: 1 vs. 1
	[...]
		Alice: (1, 9)?  N   Bob: (1, 9)?  N   Score: 9 vs. 9
		Alice: (2, 8)?  N   Bob: (2, 8)?  N   Score: 9 vs. 9
		Alice: (3, 7)?  Y

	Alice won!
