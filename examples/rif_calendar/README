Shared Calendar
---------------

This application allows users to create and share events.
All four different kinds of reclassifications (declassification, classification,
endorsement, and deprecation) are required in this application.
Also, users may choose dynamic RIF labels to associate with values, so the same 
reclassifier could have different effects on values with different specifications.
Operations involved in our shared calendar include:
â€“ Create a personal or shared event.
- Invite a user to participate in a shared event.
- Accept an invitation to participate in a shared event (triggers endorsement).
- Cancel a shared event (triggers deprecation).
- Publish/hide an event date and time (triggers declassification/classification)
- Check and announce a conflict between personal events (not canceled events) and
an invitation for a new shared event (triggers declassification).


To compile and run the shared calendar:

1. Ensure that the JRIF compiler is working.
  
   See $JIF/doc for information on compiling the JRIF compiler.

2. Ensure that the principals Alice and Bob are present.

   The code for the principals is in the $JIF/tests directory. To
   compile the code for the principals, perform the following
   commands.
        $ cd $JIF/tests
        $ $JIF/bin/jifc jif/principals/Alice.jif jif/principals/Bob.jif

3. Compile the shared calendar

        $ cd $JIF/examples/rif_calendar
        $ $JIF/bin/jifc -simpleoutput -classpath $JIF/tests *.jif

   The $JIF/tests directory must be included on the classpath so the
   JRIF compiler can locate the principals Alice and Bob.
   
4. Execute the shared calendar

        $ cd $JIF/examples/rif_calendar
        $ $JIF/bin/jif -classpath $JIF/tests Main

The output should resemble the following:
